# Mission-to-Mars

My initial web app was looking good and functioning well, but I wanted to add more polish to it. The images of Mars’s hemispheres online were absolutely stunning and the site is scraping-friendly. So I adjusted the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. To do this, I used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, stored the scraped data on a Mongo database, used a web application to display the data, and altered the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
